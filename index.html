    <h2>Privacy or comfort?</h2>
    <p>Thanks to the current situation, with the quarantines and the pandemic. Little by little we notice the vitality
      of
      technology in our lives. There are many aspects where we can no longer imagine our life without technology, not
      only for
      the entertainment and comforts, but also because we achieve that the information reaches many parts in very Little
      time.Progressively the way of communication was changed. making that people connect from far away, facilitating
      jobs,
      projects and interpersonal relationships. "Social media applications, video conferencing, and voicemails are
      playing
      pivotal roles in bridging communication gaps", Nowadays, thanks to the pandemic, there are many means of
      communication
      such as "google meet" "zoom",if we weren't had that apps, our lives would be worst in the pandemic, probable we
      wouldn't
      can take virtual classes or work.
      Globalization and great scientific research have allowed humanity achievements as great as, possessing huge
      networks
      capable of communicating information in a matter of milliseconds to the other side of the world or creating
      vaccines in
      a matter of months. However, these advances do not come alone, along with technological growth has come an immense
      loss
      in terms of privacy. Nowadays, social networks, video calls and messaging applications have become an important
      pillar
      for almost every area of ​​our life, "irrespective of locations, people can now connect with each other on a
      personal
      level" (M. Breitstein, 2018) If we were not able to use these technologies, we probably would not be able to have
      virtual classes or work, We have turned these tools into means to share every minimum aspect of our lives, we give
      permission to any application to access our data, our location, our camera etc. If we were responsible, we would
      not
      have any risk using these platforms, but we have given our privacy and our data in exchange for some comforts.

    <h2>How much do computers know about me?</h2>
    <p>When we enter a web page, it is capable of indicating certain information about our device, but what information
      can a
      page obtain without even the need to ask for permission? Well, the computer can identify the type of device, the
      browser used, the operating system in which the browser runs and
      the version of these, for example:</p>
    <p class="info"></p>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
